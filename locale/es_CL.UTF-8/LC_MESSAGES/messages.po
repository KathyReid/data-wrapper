msgid "Data Journalism opens new perspectives to do deeper and better reporting. If Journalists do really know the numbers and the data - locally, regionally or worldwide - this could lead to higher trustability and relevancy. The readers want clear signals, not some muddled up guessing. Datawrapper is a tool that makes working from data to story easier. Data should be the foundation when starting a new story, not an afterthought. In many newsrooms this is the other way round so far. „Infographics“ are usually started when the story is already done. That leads to actionism, omissions and mistakes. "
